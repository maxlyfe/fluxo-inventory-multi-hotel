  # Fix Inventory Movements RLS

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing RLS policies for inventory_movements
    - Create new policies that allow:
      - Authenticated users to read movements
      - Inventory managers and system functions to create movements
    
  2. Security
    - Maintains basic security while allowing trigger functions to work
    - Only authorized users can manually create movements
